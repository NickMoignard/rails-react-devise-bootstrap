# Rails React Devise Bootstrap

The aim of this repository is provide a Ruby On Rails and [React](https://reactjs.org)
skeleton app, including [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), which should allow you to boostrap a new
app quickly.

All the Devise views have been re-written in React.

# Usage

Fork it, rename it, build your app. ðŸ’ª

1. Click the 'Fork' button
2. Checkout the created repo on your machine and cd to the project's directory
3. Add an `upstream` remote to this repo : `git add remote upstream git@gitlab.com:zedtux/rails5-react-devise-bootstrap.git`
4. Rename the app from `config/application.rb` and change the title
   from `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
5. Use your local Ruby, Bundler and Yarn or the Dockerfile in order to prepare
   your development environment
6. Start the web server and go to http://localhost:3000/

## Why should I fork it ?

With this project forked, and a git remote to this project, you will be able to
fetch the updates and keep an up-to-date version of the stack.

When Rails, React, Devise or Bootstrap is updated, you could update your project
following those instructions :

```
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b tasks/update-base-stack
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

From now on, this new branch `tasks/update-base-stack` has the updated stack as
if you just forked it and added your app in it.

Run your tests and if all is fine, merge it to `master` ðŸŽ‰

# Stack

Here is the project stack :

 * Rails 5 (5.1.5)
 * React 16 (16.2.0) via webpacker
 * Redux (5.0.7)
 * Devise 4 (4.4.3)
 * Boostrap 4 (4.0.0)

# Architecture

This app using the standard Rails way to implement React.

The entrypoint to the React application is at `app/javascript/packs/application.js`.

Then you'll find a standard React redux structure in the `app/javascript/`
folder, with a Router in the `components/AppRouter.js` file.

Also you will find all the Devise views re-written in React in the
`app/javascript/views/devise` folder.
